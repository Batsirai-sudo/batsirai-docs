## What is WebCli Module

The WebCli module creates a comprehensive JavaScript-based API and command-line
interface for Elementor that's accessible through the browser console.

It exposes a global $e object that provides developers with powerful tools to interact with Elementor programmatically.

## Core Functionality
1. Global API Access: Creates window.$e - a global JavaScript object that developers can use in the browser
console or scripts
2. Command System: Provides a robust command infrastructure with:
   - Public Commands ($e.commands) - For general operations
   - Internal Commands ($e.commandsInternal) - For internal Elementor operations
   - Data Commands ($e.data) - For data operations
   - Command registration, execution, validation, and tracing
   - Shortcut support for commands
3. Component Architecture:
   - Modular component system ($e.components)
   - Component registration and management
   - Modal components support
4. Hooks System ($e.hooks): WordPress-style hooks for:
   - Actions and filters
   - UI hooks
   - Data hooks
5. Routing ($e.routes): Navigation and routing capabilities
6. Data Management ($e.data): Centralized data operations
7. State Management ($e.store, $e.uiStates): Application state management
8. Utilities:
   - Console logging with Elementor branding
   - Shortcuts system
   - Hash-based commands
   - Backwards compatibility layer
9. Developer Benefits
   - This module essentially turns the browser console into a powerful debugging and development tool for Elementor, allowing developers to:
   - Execute Elementor commands directly from the console
   - Inspect and manipulate Elementor's internal state
   - Test component functionality
   - Debug issues with proper error handling and tracing
   - Access Elementor's data layer programmatically
   - Navigate between different Elementor views/routes
